You've got a list of suspicious IPs in CIDR notation. 

You need to block requests arriving from these IPs. Implement the  fun isAllowed(incomingIp: String): Boolean
You can't use 3thd party solutions



The implementation has to be in Kotlin



A working solution isn't the only requirement. The code should be simple (to read and understand), robust and testable (you don't have to write the actual tests though..). 


1. how the example list looks like? the list is closed CIDR list of IP that you are supplying 

2.how do we get the CIDR list? 
The list is supplied by you, itâ€™s a closed list with n elements you. will set in the main class of your solution.
The list is not changing during running time.


You can do any manipulation on the list before using it in the isAllowed function  
You can also use any data structures you like to help you shorten running time or complexity
